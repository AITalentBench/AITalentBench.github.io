In this competition, you will be challenged to construct a generative model to simulate fake time series to mimic the distribution of the price and volatility process of multiple financial instruments as much as possible. For evaluation metrics, please visit Evaluation section. The dataset for this challenge consists of sample trajectories of the price and volatility of two assets. Given the market may typically have high volatility and low volatility episodes, these samples display distinct patterns corresponding to each regime, as illustrated by the following figure.
