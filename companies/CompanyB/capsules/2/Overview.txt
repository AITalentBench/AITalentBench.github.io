Limited availability of financial and economic data poses a challenge for applying machine learning algorithms in the finance sector. High-fidelity synthetic data generation offers a solution by creating data that mirrors real statistics while protecting privacy. Popular generative models like GANs, VAE, and diffusion models are commonly used. Financial time series have unique characteristics like time heterogeneity and low signal-noise ratio, often showing abrupt changes related to events like financial crises or policy changes. Asset price processes behave differently during crises compared to stable periods. Developing robust generative models is crucial for simulating synthetic financial time series, especially for datasets with structural shifts. Neglecting these changes could lead to financial losses and inaccurate risk assessment. This competition aims to advance generative model methodologies for handling regime-switching time series data.
