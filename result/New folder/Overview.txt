The limited availability of financial and economic data is a key bottleneck that limits the successful applications of machine learning algorithms in the finance sector. High-fidelity synthetic data generation provides a promising means to augment data that resembles the statistics of real data while preserving data privacy. Popular generative models include Generative adversarial networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and more recent diffusion models. Financial time series have unique characteristics such as time heterogeneity, and low signal-noise ratio. In particular, many economic and financial time series exhibit abrupt changes in the patterns, which are often associated with events, such as financial crises, pandemics, and government policy changes. An important illustrative example is the financial price time series, which is typically affected by the fundamentals of markets. The dynamics of the asset price processes behave in significantly different ways during periods of financial crisis compared to more economically stable periods. Developing robust and high-fidelity generative models is crucial for simulating synthetic financial time series, especially for the financial dataset exhibiting structural shifts. If these models overlook structural changes in patterns of financial time series, it could result in significant financial losses and inaccurate risk assessment. Thus, this competition seeks to engage participants in advancing the generative model methodologies for handling regime-switching time series data.
