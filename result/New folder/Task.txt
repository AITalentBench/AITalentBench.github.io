In this competition, you will be challenged to construct a generative model to simulate fake time series to mimic the distribution of the price and volatility process of multiple financial instruments as much as possible. For evaluation metrics, please visit Evaluation section. The dataset for this challenge consists of sample trajectories of the price and volatility of two assets. Given the market may typically have high volatility and low volatility episodes, these samples display distinct patterns corresponding to each regime, as illustrated by the following figure. 

While the competition dataset is model-generated, the top-performing generative models may have huge potential to be successfully applied to empirical financial time series with impact. The use cases span from sharing sensitive financial data and training advanced ML models to augment scarce historical records. For example, high-quality market generators that are capable of generating realistic scenarios would significantly boost ML-driven trading or hedging strategies, such as deep hedging, while improving risk management.

Throughout this competition, you will gain hands-on experience in developing and training generative models on financial time series data. For those new to time series generative models, our Starter Kit offers an efficient pipeline to guide your journey. We also offer a comprehensive pipeline for synthetic time series generation (see Timeseries Generation Pipeline GitHub), featuring popular models like TimeGAN, RCGAN, and TimeVAE, all of which can be applied to the competition's data. We wish you a rewarding experience in the competition.
