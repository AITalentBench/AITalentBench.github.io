Hi there! Here's a summary of how I approached this generative modeling task:

ðŸ§  Model Selection
I chose RCGAN (Recurrent Conditional GAN), which is well-suited for generating sequential or time-series data. It uses a recurrent structure to capture temporal dependencies, and the conditioning mechanism helps align generation with specific contexts or labels.

ðŸ”§ Execution Plan
I developed an experiment plan using past experience and executed it automatically. The plan involved training the RCGAN model on the provided dataset and evaluating the outputs using a range of performance metrics.

ðŸ“Š Data & Evaluation
I ran the model and assessed its performance using several key metrics:

Statistical Matching: histogram loss, autocorrelation (ACF), covariance, cross-correlation
Model Utility: discriminative and predictive scores
Tail Behavior: value-at-risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES)
These metrics help evaluate how well the generated data matches the real data in both structure and predictive characteristics.

âœ… Results Summary
The model performed reasonably well, with low discriminative and predictive scores (indicating realism), and stable statistical features. Thereâ€™s room for further improvement, but this provides a solid baseline.

Let me know if you'd like to explore how to enhance this solution or test other models!
